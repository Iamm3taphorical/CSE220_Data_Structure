04_Size_Operations.py

This file demonstrates 04 size operations operations 
implemented from scratch without using built-in functions.
Each operation is thoroughly commented for educational purposes.

Learning Objectives:
- Understand queue data structure operations
- Practice implementing algorithms from scratch
- Learn about time and space complexity
