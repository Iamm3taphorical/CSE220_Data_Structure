Recursion.py

This file demonstrates recursion operations 
implemented from scratch without using built-in functions.
Each operation is thoroughly commented for educational purposes.

Topic: Recursion
Operation: Recursion

Learning Objectives:
- Understand recursion data structure operations
- Practice implementing algorithms from scratch
- Learn about time and space complexity
- Master recursion techniques
