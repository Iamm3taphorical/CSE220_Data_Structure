LINKED LIST INSERTION - THEORY AND CONCEPTS
================================================

DEFINITION:
Insertion in a linked list involves adding a new node into the list either at the head, tail, or at a specific position. The operation requires updating the pointers to maintain the list structure.

INSERTION TECHNIQUES:
1. Insert at Head:
   - New node becomes the first node
   - Head is updated to point to the new node
   
2. Insert at Tail:
   - Traverse to the last node
   - Append the new node at the end
   
3. Insert at a Specific Position:
   - Traverse to the node after which the new node is to be inserted
   - Update pointers to include the new node

USES:
1. Stack Implementation: Pushing elements onto a stack
2. Queue Implementation: Adding elements to the end of a queue
3. List Management: Maintaining ordered lists
4. Undo Mechanisms: Inserting undo states
5. Game Development: Managing player actions or states

PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY:
- When needing to quickly add elements: Insert at head
- To maintain insertion order: Insert at tail
- For specific sequences: Insert at a given position

TIME COMPLEXITY:
- Insertion at Head: O(1)
- Insertion at Tail (when tail reference is not maintained): O(n)
- Insertion at Tail (with tail reference): O(1)
- Insertion at Position: O(n)

SPACE COMPLEXITY:
- All insertions: O(1) additional space for pointer adjustments

PRACTICES:
1. Always check for null pointers
2. Maintain consistent node structure
3. Handle edge cases like empty list
4. Use helper methods to simplify operations
5. Document each insertion for clarity
