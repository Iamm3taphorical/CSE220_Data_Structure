22_Odd_Index_Extraction.py

This file demonstrates 22 odd index extraction operations 
implemented from scratch without using built-in functions.
Each operation is thoroughly commented for educational purposes.

Learning Objectives:
- Understand arrays data structure operations
- Practice implementing algorithms from scratch
- Learn about time and space complexity
