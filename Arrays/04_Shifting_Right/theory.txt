ARRAY RIGHT SHIFT - THEORY AND CONCEPTS
==========================================

DEFINITION:
Array right shift moves all elements in an array to the right by a specified number of positions. Elements that would go beyond the array boundary are typically lost or wrapped around, depending on the implementation.

FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS:
1. Element Movement: Each element moves to a higher index position
2. Boundary Handling: Elements at the end need special consideration
3. Position Calculation: New position = current position + shift amount
4. Data Loss: Elements that shift beyond array bounds are lost

TYPES OF RIGHT SHIFT:
1. Linear Shift: Elements that go beyond bounds are lost
2. Circular Shift: Elements wrap around to the beginning
3. Shift with Fill: Empty positions are filled with default values

USE CASES:
1. Data Processing: Implementing delay lines in signal processing
2. Animation: Creating sliding effects in graphics
3. Buffer Management: Implementing circular buffers
4. Cryptography: Bit manipulation in encryption algorithms
5. Game Development: Moving game objects or implementing scrolling
6. Algorithm Implementation: Used in sorting and searching algorithms

PROBLEM-SOLVING INTUITION:
- When you need to create space at the beginning: Use right shift
- When implementing circular data structures: Use circular right shift
- When simulating time-based delays: Use right shift with fill
- When reorganizing data for processing: Use right shift operations

SHIFT OPERATIONS:
1. Determine shift amount and direction
2. Handle boundary conditions
3. Move elements to new positions
4. Fill empty positions if needed
5. Handle wraparound for circular shifts

TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n) where n is the number of elements
SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1) for in-place shift, O(n) for new array

REAL-WORLD ANALOGIES:
- People shifting seats to the right in a theater row
- Moving items on a conveyor belt
- Sliding tiles in a puzzle game
- Advancing frames in a film reel

COMMON PITFALLS:
1. Index Out of Bounds: Not handling array boundaries properly
2. Data Loss: Forgetting that elements can be lost in linear shifts
3. Shift Amount Validation: Not handling negative or excessive shift amounts
4. Empty Position Handling: Not filling empty positions appropriately
5. Circular Logic Errors: Incorrect wraparound calculations
