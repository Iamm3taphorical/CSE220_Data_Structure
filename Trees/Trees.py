Trees.py

This file demonstrates trees operations 
implemented from scratch without using built-in functions.
Each operation is thoroughly commented for educational purposes.

Topic: Trees
Operation: Trees

Learning Objectives:
- Understand trees data structure operations
- Practice implementing algorithms from scratch
- Learn about time and space complexity
- Master trees techniques
